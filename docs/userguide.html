      INTRODUCTION

    </div>
    <p>

      This application allows the Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) of
      Bodgitt and Scarper, LLC., a broker of home improvement contractors, to
      generate a list of contractors that match a customer's criteria.

    </p>
    <p>

      The application can be run in single-user (standalone) or multi-user
      (networked) mode. The multi-user mode uses a single "server" machine and
      one or more "client" machines.

    </p>
    <div class="header1">

      AUDIENCE

    </div>
    <p>

      These guidelines are provided for network administrators and users who
      are already familiar with the broad purpose of the project.

    </p>
    <div class="header1">

      ASSUMPTIONS

    </div>
    <p>

      These guidelines assume that a Java 2 Runtime Environment is already
      installed and all commands will be started from a Windows or UNIX/Linux
      shell command line.

    </p>
    <div class="header1">

      SERVER OPERATION

    </div>
    <p>

      Start the server from the directory where the database resides, using the following command line:

    </p>
    <pre>
java -jar runme.jar server
    </pre>
    <p>

      (If the <code>runme.jar</code> file is not located in the current
      directory, supply the full or relative path to the jar file.)

    </p>
    <p>

      The server will normally produce output like the following:

    </p>
    <pre>
Apr 28, 2004 2:25:16 PM suncertify.protocol.server.SubcontractorCommandServer server
INFO: rmi://192.168.0.101:1099/SCJD-Subcontractor registered.
    </pre>
    <p>

      The server will run and handle requests until it is manually stopped.

      To stop the server, simply type <code>&lt;control-c&gt;</code>.

    <p>

      If another instance of the server is already running, the new server will
      produce error output like the following and then exit:

    </p>
    <pre>
Apr 28, 2004 2:55:58 PM suncertify.protocol.server.SubcontractorCommandServer server
SEVERE: Exiting -- java.rmi.AlreadyBoundException: rmi://192.168.0.101:1099/SCJD-Subcontractor
    </pre>
    <p>

      If a non-JRMP server is already listening at the standard (1099) port,
      the new server will product error output like the following and then exit:

    </p>
    <pre>
Apr 28, 2004 2:12:20 PM suncertify.protocol.server.SubcontractorCommandServer server
SEVERE: Exiting -- java.rmi.ConnectIOException: non-JRMP server at remote endpoint
    </pre>
    <p>

      If these (or other) errors occur, please consult your network administrator for help.

    </p>
    <div class="header1">

      REMOTE CLIENT START-UP

    </div>
    <p>

      Start the Graphical User Interface (GUI) client in "remote" mode using
      the following command line:

    </p>
    <pre>
java -jar runme.jar
    </pre>
    <p>

      (If the <code>runme.jar</code> file is not located in the current
      directory, supply the full or relative path to the jar file.)

    </p>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>

          If the GUI client has been connected to a remote server in the past
          and the server is running, the GUI table will automatically be filled
          with Subcontractors to choose from.

        </li>
        <li>

          If this is the first time you have run the GUI in "remote" mode, the
          table will be empty.

        </li>
        <li>

          If you have run the GUI in "remote" mode but the server is not
          running, you will see an error dialog window indicating that the
          server is not available. Simply press "OK". The table will be empty.
          You will now be able to select another server.

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    </p>
    <div class="header1">

      LOCAL CLIENT START-UP

    </div>
    <p>

      Start the GUI client in "standalone" mode using the following command line:

    </p>
    <pre>
java -jar runme.jar alone
    </pre>
    <p>

      (If the <code>runme.jar</code> file is not located in the current
      directory, supply the full or relative path to the jar file.)

    </p>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>

          If the GUI client has been connected to a local database in the past,
          the GUI table will automatically be filled with Subcontractors to
          choose from.

        </li>
        <li>

          If this is the first time you have run the GUI in "standalone" mode,
          the table will be empty.

        </li>
      </ul>

      GUI CLIENT OPERATION

    </div>
    <div class="header2">

      Introduction

    </div>
    <p>

      When the table contains Subcontractors  and you have selected a
      Subcontractor, the window looks like this:

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_selected.jpg" />

    </div>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>

          The "Search for Matching Subcontractors" button is enabled when the
          table contains Subcontractors and is disabled when the table is
          empty.

        </li>
        <li>

          The "Book Selected Subcontractor" button is enabled when you have
          selected a Subcontractor (row) and disabled when no Subcontractors
          are selected.

        </li>
        <li>

          You can operate the horizontal and vertical scroll bars to view the
          hidden portions of the table.

        </li>
        <li>

          You can rearrange the columns by "dragging and dropping" the column
          headings. 
          
          (Note: The columns will return to their default sequence each time
          you perform a search.)

        </li>
        <li>

          The bottom line in the window displays the status of the most recent
          operation you performed.

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="header2">

      Selecting a Local Database

    </div>
    <p>

      To select a local database, access the "File > Use Local Database" menu item.

      Then select a file from the chooser dialog window:

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_filechooser.jpg" />

    </div>
    <p>

      If the database filename is valid, the table will be loaded with
      Subcontractors to choose from.

    </p>
    <p>

      If the database filename is not valid or you chose a file that is not a
      valid database, you will get an error dialog window like the following:

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_file_error.jpg" />

    </div>
    <div class="header2">

      Selecting a Remote Server

    </div>
    <p>

      To select a remote server, access the "File > Connect To Server" menu item.

      Then enter the IP address or hostname of the system (that is running the
      server) in the dialog window:

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_server.jpg" />

    </div>
    <p>

      If the system name is valid and the server is running, the table will
      be loaded with Subcontractors to choose from.

    </p>
    <p>

      If the server is not running on the system you specified, you will get an
      error dialog window like the following:

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_server_error.jpg" />

    </div>
    <div class="header2">

      Searching for Matching Subcontractors

    </div>
    <p>

      You can fill in the "Subcontractor Name" and/or "City" fields with the
      first few characters of the name of a subcontractor or city, then press
      the "Search for Matching Subcontractors" button, to narrow you search for
      subcontractors.

    </p>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>

          Uppercase and lowercase are ignored during searches.

        </li>
        <li>

          Example: match string "rem" matches <i>"Remodelers"</i>, <i>"REM
          Builders"</i> and <i>"Remy, Inc."</i> but not <i>"Rebuilt"</i>.

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="header2">

      Sorting the Table

    </div>
    <p>

      You can click on any column heading in the table, to sort the entire table by that column.
      
      When you click the column heading more than once, the sort changes
      between ascending and descending order.

    </p>
    <div class="header2">

      Booking a Subcontractor

    </div>
    <p>

      Click on a row in the table to select a Subcontractor, then click the
      "Book Selected Subcontractor" button to book the selected Subcontractor.
      
      The following dialog window will be displayed. Enter the one to eight
      digit Customer Id and press "OK":

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_book.jpg" />

    </div>
    <p>

      It is possible that another CSR already booked the same Subcontractor you
      selected, between the time you selected the Subcontractor and tried to
      book it.

      When this happens, you will see an error dialog window like the following:

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_book_error.jpg" />

    </div>
    <p>

      Instead, you will need to select another Subcontractor.

    </p>
    <div class="header2">

      Displaying the User Guide

    </div>
    <p>

      Access the "Help > User Guide" menu item to display the following window,
      that simply refers you to the document you are currently reading:

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_userguide.jpg" />

    </div>
    <div class="header2">

      Displaying the "About" Window

    </div>
    <p>

      Access the "Help > About" menu item to display the following window,
      that provides information about the application and its version number:

    </p>
    <div class="image">

      <img src="images/csrgui_about.jpg" />

    </div>
    <div class="header2">

      Exiting the GUI Client

    </div>
    <p>

      Access the "File > Exit" menu item to exit the application.

      You will see the following confirmation window:
